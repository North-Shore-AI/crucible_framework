```latex
\begin{abstract}
We investigate the reliability of multi-model ensembles for mathematical reasoning
using a randomized controlled trial. We employ the Elixir AI Research Framework
\cite{elixir_ai_research2025} to conduct 3 experiments with 200 queries across
4 ensemble sizes (1, 3, 5, 7 models). Our results show that 5-model ensembles
significantly outperform single models with very large effect sizes. Specifically,
the 5-model ensemble achieved 96.3\% accuracy (SD=1.2\%) compared to 89.1\% (SD=2.1\%)
for single model baseline, representing a 7.2 percentage point improvement
(p < 0.001, d = 3.42). These findings have implications for deploying reliable
AI systems in production environments. All code and data are available at

## Methods Section Templates

### Experimental Design Template

```latex
\section{Methods}
\label{sec:methods}

\subsection{Experimental Design}

We conducted a [design type, e.g., randomized controlled trial] to test the
hypothesis that [hypothesis statement]. The independent variable was
[IV description] with [number] levels: [level descriptions]. The dependent
variable was [DV description], measured as [measurement method].

\textbf{Participants/Queries:} We sampled [number] queries from [dataset]
\cite{dataset_citation}. [Sampling method and justification].

\textbf{Conditions:} We implemented [number] experimental conditions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Baseline:} [Description]
    \item \textbf{Treatment 1:} [Description]
    \item \textbf{Treatment 2:} [Description]
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Procedure:} For each query in each condition, we [procedure description].
We repeated the entire experiment [number] times to account for stochastic
variation in model outputs and API latencies.

\textbf{Randomization:} Query order was randomized using a seeded random number
generator (seed=42) to ensure reproducibility while preventing order effects.

\subsection{Implementation}

We implemented all experiments using the Elixir AI Research Framework
\cite{elixir_ai_research2025}, which provides research-grade instrumentation
and statistical analysis capabilities.

\textbf{Ensemble Implementation:} We used the Ensemble library
\cite{ensemble2025} to implement multi-model voting with majority strategy.
Models were queried in parallel with a timeout of [timeout] seconds.

\textbf{Statistical Analysis:} We used the Bench library \cite{bench2025}
for statistical testing. We employed [test name] to compare conditions, with
$\alpha = 0.05$ as the significance threshold. Effect sizes were calculated
using [effect size measure] following Cohen (1988) \cite{cohen1988statistical}.

\textbf{Hardware:} Experiments were conducted on [hardware description].

\textbf{Cost:} Total experiment cost was approximately \$[cost], with
[per-query cost] per query.

\subsection{Metrics}

We measured the following metrics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Accuracy:} Percentage of correct predictions
    \item \textbf{Latency:} Time from query submission to response (P50, P95, P99)
    \item \textbf{Cost:} Total API cost per query in USD
    \item \textbf{Consensus:} Agreement rate among ensemble members (0-1)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reproducibility}

To ensure reproducibility, we:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Fixed random seeds for all stochastic operations
    \item Recorded exact model versions (GPT-4: gpt-4-0613, Claude: claude-3-opus-20240229)
    \item Saved all experimental artifacts (configurations, raw results, analysis scripts)
    \item Published code and data at [repository URL]
\end{enumerate}

All experiments are reproducible using the command:

\begin{verbatim}
mix run experiments/h1_ensemble.exs --seed 42
\end{verbatim}
```

### Statistical Analysis Template

```latex
\subsection{Statistical Analysis}

\textbf{Hypothesis Testing:} We tested the null hypothesis that [H0 description]
against the alternative hypothesis that [H1 description]. Given [data characteristics],
we used [test name] with [assumptions description].

\textbf{Sample Size:} We determined sample size using a priori power analysis.
To detect a [effect size] effect with power = [power] and $\alpha = 0.05$,
we required $n \geq [n]$ per condition. We collected $n = [actual n]$ to
ensure adequate power.

\textbf{Multiple Comparisons:} When comparing more than two conditions, we
applied [correction method] correction to control family-wise error rate.

\textbf{Effect Sizes:} We report Cohen's $d$ for all pairwise comparisons,
interpreting $d \geq 0.2$ as small, $d \geq 0.5$ as medium, and $d \geq 0.8$
as large effects \cite{cohen1988statistical}.

\textbf{Confidence Intervals:} We report 95\% confidence intervals for all
effect size estimates using [bootstrap/parametric] methods.

\textbf{Assumptions:} We tested statistical assumptions using [tests]:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Normality: [test] ($p = [p-value]$)
    \item Homogeneity of variance: [test] ($p = [p-value]$)
    \item Independence: Verified by experimental design
\end{itemize}

When assumptions were violated, we used [non-parametric alternative].

## Results Section Templates

### Descriptive Statistics Template

```latex
\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

\subsection{Descriptive Statistics}

Table \ref{tab:descriptive} presents descriptive statistics for all experimental
conditions. [Condition name] achieved the highest accuracy ($M = [mean]$,
$SD = [sd]$), followed by [other conditions].

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Descriptive statistics by experimental condition}
\label{tab:descriptive}
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
\toprule
Condition & $M$ & $SD$ & $Min$ & $Max$ \\
\midrule
Baseline & 89.1 & 2.1 & 85.5 & 92.0 \\
Treatment 1 & 94.3 & 1.5 & 91.8 & 96.5 \\
Treatment 2 & 96.3 & 1.2 & 94.2 & 98.0 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Figure \ref{fig:distribution} shows the distribution of accuracy scores across
conditions. [Description of patterns].
```

### Inferential Statistics Template

```latex
\subsection{Inferential Statistics}

We conducted [test name] to compare accuracy across conditions. Results showed
a statistically significant effect of condition on accuracy,
$F([df1], [df2]) = [F-value]$, $p < [p-value]$, $\eta^2 = [effect-size]$.

Post-hoc pairwise comparisons using [correction method] revealed:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Treatment 1 vs. Baseline: $t([df]) = [t-value]$, $p < [p-value]$,
          $d = [effect-size]$ (95\% CI: [[lower], [upper]])
    \item Treatment 2 vs. Baseline: $t([df]) = [t-value]$, $p < [p-value]$,
          $d = [effect-size]$ (95\% CI: [[lower], [upper]])
    \item Treatment 2 vs. Treatment 1: $t([df]) = [t-value]$, $p = [p-value]$,
          $d = [effect-size]$ (95\% CI: [[lower], [upper]])
\end{itemize}

All pairwise comparisons except [exception] reached statistical significance
at the Bonferroni-corrected $\alpha = [adjusted-alpha]$ level.

\subsection{Effect Sizes}

Effect sizes were large for all comparisons. Treatment 2 showed a very large
effect relative to baseline ($d = 3.42$), indicating practical significance
in addition to statistical significance.
```

### Cost-Benefit Analysis Template

```latex
\subsection{Cost-Benefit Analysis}

While Treatment 2 achieved highest accuracy, it also incurred highest cost
(Table \ref{tab:cost}). We calculated cost per percentage point improvement
as:

\begin{equation}
    \text{Cost Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Cost}}{\text{Accuracy Improvement}}
\end{equation}

Treatment 1 offered the best cost-efficiency at \$0.42 per percentage point,
compared to \$1.03 for Treatment 2.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Cost-benefit analysis}
\label{tab:cost}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
Condition & Cost & Accuracy Gain & Cost/Point \\
\midrule
Baseline & \$0.01 & - & - \\
Treatment 1 & \$0.03 & 5.2\% & \$0.42 \\
Treatment 2 & \$0.09 & 7.2\% & \$1.03 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

For production deployments, Treatment 1 offers an optimal balance of reliability
improvement and cost.

Cite the main framework if you use any of its libraries. Additionally cite
specific libraries you use extensively.

### Can I modify the framework for my research?

Yes! The framework is open source (MIT license). If you make modifications,
please:
1. Document your changes clearly
2. Indicate that you used a modified version
3. Consider contributing improvements back

### Should I cite the framework in the abstract?

Generally no. Cite in the Methods section where you describe your implementation.
Mention in the abstract only if the framework itself is a contribution of the paper.

### How do I handle framework updates during research?

1. Pin to a specific version at start of research
2. Document the version number
3. Don't update mid-study unless fixing a critical bug
4. If you must update, note this and re-run validation checks

### What if I can't share my dataset?

If dataset is proprietary:
1. Describe it thoroughly in the methods
2. Share aggregated statistics
3. Provide code for reproduction with public datasets
4. Consider releasing a subset or synthetic version
